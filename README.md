# Final Practice Answers

## What is this?
This is a GitHub repository with my answers to the practice final. Please don't use the code in this for anything other than review (it's pretty useless). Keep any discussion under this repository academically honest please.

## Contributing or fixing errors
If you find an error in the answers, please let me know so that I can fix it. I will see posts on Piazza as well as issues/pull requests on GitHub. I am certain that there are errors in my answers, and it would be very helpful to be made aware of them.

## Using this repository
My answers are uploaded in pdf form, and the code is under the *Code* directory. Answers that I am very not sure of have a '?' or similar. If you know the answers to these, let me know as explained above. I've decided to upload the original word document as well, though this cannot be viewed online. If you want to make changes, feel free to post an issue or pull request. GitHub won't show the text in the word document, so it'd be better to post and issue/comment on piazza if you have a suggestion or want to fix something in the answer text. 
GitHub will handle code pull requests well (shocking I know), so feel free to do so if you have better/other example code.

## Please don't post any code from the projects or the Linked List problem!
